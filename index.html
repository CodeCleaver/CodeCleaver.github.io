            <h2>The Story of Code Cleaver</h2>
            <p>My name is Jason and in 2021 I decided to learn to code. As 
                I began my journey into the complex world of programming I found myself 
                constantly scouring the internet for answers to my questions:</p>
                <br>
                <p class="questionslist">"How do I know I am on the right learning path?" 
                    "When can I start making money coding?" "Which coding language is right 
                    for me?"</p>
                <br>
                <p class="story-bottom">                
                Just a few of the questions you may have found yourself asking. 
                I found that the more I learnt the more I needed to know and 
                before I knew it I often found myself spending more time 
                searching for these answers than writing code! That is why 
                I have set out to eliminate all that wasted time trawling 
                through the incorrect information and get you straight to the 
                right answer.
