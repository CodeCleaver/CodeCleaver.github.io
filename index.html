            <hr>
            <p>2020 came to an end, along with my career as a sales leader within the five-star hotel industry - at least for the foreseeable future. 
                Thank you, COVID. To generate income during these life-changing times I rented out my one-bedroom London apartment, moved in with my partner, 
                and have since been working as a delivery driver for an online grocery company.</p>
                <h3>Sounds like the life, right?</h3>
                <p>Having been let go due to COVID after having spent 13 years building my hotel sales career I was left lacking an outlet for my creativity and drive. 
                I would spend the time applying for jobs in other industries just to be told I was either too experienced or didnt have experience within that industry. 
                Challenging times.</p>

                <h3>Something had to change</h3>

                <p>On the 4th January 2021, I made the decision to start learning to code. One month later and I've made hundreds of mistakes and met dozens of brick walls, 
                yet I find myself waking up each morning excited to continue to learn. To keep myself accountable I will be making blog posts weekly, 
                sharing my experiences as I continue along my life's new trajectory into the world of coding and tech.<br><br>
                My goal is to provide an easy-to-follow, laugh, cry and learn experience for people who are new to or thinking about learning to code. 
                I'm making all of the mistakes so that you don't have to. So if you're looking to get tricks, tips, and the do's and don'ts when first starting 
                out then welcome to Code Cleaver.</p>
